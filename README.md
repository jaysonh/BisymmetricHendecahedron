## About
This is a Processing app to generate bisymmetric hendecahedron shapes. These are 3D shapes that are used for space filling structures and an experiment to see if they are appropriate to use for creating rocks shaped structures for our Soma projects. The processing app generates an svg or pdf of a flat foldable version of the shape that can be printed out and then glued together to form 3D structures.
